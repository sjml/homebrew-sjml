# Shane's Personal Homebrew Tap

Just some formulae and casks to make tools I made easily installable.

## Available Tools
* `paper`: A command-line tool for tracking references and compiling a finished academic paper from Markdown. ([repo](https://github.com/sjml/paper))

## Available Apps
* `dotfile-watcher`: A program that watches a given directory and pops a menu notifier if there's uncommited changes in it. Useful if you keep your dotfiles in Git and want to know if anything gets changed behind your back. ([repo](https://github.com/sjml/DotfileWatcher))
* `dualcam`: The simplest way to look at two USB cameras at once. ([repo](https://github.com/sjml/DualCam))

## To install
`brew install --cask sjml/sjml/<cask>`

Or `brew tap sjml/sjml` and then `brew install --cask <cask>`.
