# Shane's Personal Homebrew Tap

Just some casks for apps that I made and want to easily install on new computers. 

## Available Apps
* dotfile-watcher: A program that watches a given directory and pops a menu notifier if there's uncommited changes in it. Useful if you keep your dotfiles in Git and want to know if anything gets changed behind your back. ([repo](https://github.com/sjml/DotfileWatcher))
* dualcam: The simplest way to look at two USB cameras at once. ([repo](https://github.com/sjml/DualCam))

## To install
`brew install --cask sjml/sjml/<cask>`

Or `brew tap sjml/sjml` and then `brew install --cask <cask>`.
